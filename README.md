# SmartZone Reversal Master ReadMe

## Overview
The SmartZone Reversal Master is a trading robot that is based on the SmartZone Reversal Master indicator. This indicator is a reliable tool for making trade entry decisions in the forex market. It utilizes liquidity engineering and high-resolution trend analysis principles to identify institutional key levels and track price movements relative to these levels. 

The SmartZone Reversal Master indicator is designed to identify potential price reversals and align them with the overall trend, increasing the accuracy of market predictions. It is particularly beneficial during ICT killzones when market volatility tends to spike. Traders can apply their preferred reversal indicators or methods to pinpoint suitable entries on lower timeframes once potential trade entry points are identified.

## How It Works
The SmartZone Reversal Master trading robot works by utilizing the SmartZone Reversal Master indicator to identify potential trade entry points. It constantly monitors the market and checks for any potential trade setups based on the indicator's signals.

When the indicator detects a potential trade entry point, the trading robot places a trade based on the entry point. It determines whether to enter a buy or sell trade based on the type of entry point indicated by the indicator. 

The trading robot uses the Trade class to execute trades. It sets the maximum deviation in points using the SetDeviationInPoints method to ensure that the trade is executed within a specified deviation limit. 

The trading robot continuously checks for potential trade entry points on each tick event and executes trades accordingly. 

## Usage
1. Include the necessary libraries: Trade.mqh and SmartZoneReversalMaster.mqh.
2. Define global variables for the Trade and SmartZoneReversalMaster class instances.
3. Initialize the indicator by setting its parameters and attaching it to the chart.
4. Initialize the trade class by setting the maximum deviation in points.
5. Handle the tick events and check for potential trade entry points using the HasPotentialEntryPoint method of the indicator.
6. If a potential entry point is detected, get the entry point details using the GetEntryPointPrice and GetEntryPointType methods.
7. Place a trade based on the entry point by calling the Buy or Sell method of the trade class.
8. Detach the indicator from the chart during deinitialization.
